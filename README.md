**LetterTracker**

The application is designed to analyze text and find the first unique character in each word. It performs the following steps:

1. The program accepts arbitrary text as input to be analyzed.

2. Next, the program splits the text into words. Words can be separated by spaces, punctuation marks, or other characters.

3. For each word in the text, the program finds the first character that is no longer repeated within that word. 
    To do this, it scans each character of the word and tracks the count of each character's occurrences.

4. After finding the first non-repeated character for each word, the program collects all these characters into a set.

5. The program then selects the first unique character from this set, which means the character no longer occurs in the set.

6. The selected unique character is returned as the result of the application.

Thus, the application analyzes the text, finds the first non-repeated character in each word, and returns the first unique character among all the found characters.
This algorithm efficiently finds and returns the first unique character in the text, processing each word independently of others and performing a minimal number of operations for the search.
